### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

PCA means Principal Component Analysis.

It is commonly known for dimensionality reduction.

Steps to implement PCA:
1. stop
2. Import Packages
3. Create a dummy dataset
4. Subtract the mean of each variable
5. Calculate the covariance matrix of the mean-centered data
6. Calculate the eigen vectors and eigen values of the covariance matrix
7. Sort the given vector in descending order. Also, sort the eigen value
8. Select thye first n eigenvector, n is desired dimension of our final data
9. Select a subset from the rearranged Eigenvalue matrix
10. Transfer the data
11. Reduce the dimension and print it
12. Stop
